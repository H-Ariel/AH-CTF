# CTF
_by Ariel Halili_

I participated in Barak Gonen's CTF and it was fun.

Here is one of mine :)

## How to start?
Make sure you installed Python on your computer.

Run `python ah_ctf.pyc` and and enjoy!

NOTE: You have the source code if you want to create your own CTF besd on this project.

> In the land of code and mystery,<br>
Lizards guard with pride and glee,<br>
Amazing QR codes to crack,<br>
Unveil the secrets, never slack.<br><br>
Cool server, puzzles to brag,<br>
Find the treasure, grab the flag,<br>
In the kingdom, we stand tall,<br>
CTF glory, we claim it all.<br>
